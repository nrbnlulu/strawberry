class MyExtension(SchemaExtension):

    async def on_operation(self, execution_context):
        #  This part is called before the subscription started
        yield
        #  This part is called after the subscription ended

    async def on_execute(self, execution_context):
        #  This part is called before a new result is comming from the subscription
        yield
        #  This part is called after the subscription yielded a result
```
